            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have now a double advantage upon you, through the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, who ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares with us. And as for us, we have ſeen great things in this laſt mercy: It is not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to any we have had, as followeth:</p>
            <p>Wee were advanced to <hi>Long-Sutton,</hi> neere a very ſtrong Place of the Enemies, called <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> farre from our owne Garriſons, without
<pb facs="tcp:186862:3"/>much Ammunition, in a place extreamly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in proviſions, the malignant Club-men interpoſing, who are ready to take all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages againſt our parties, and would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take them againſt our Armie, if they had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. <hi>Goring</hi> ſtood upon the advantage of ſtrong paſſes, ſtaying untill the reſt of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats came up to his Army, with a reſolution not to engage, untill <hi>Greenvill</hi> and Prince CHARLES his men were come up to him. We could not well have neceſſitated him to an Engagement, nor have ſtayed one day longer without retreating to our Ammunition, and to conveniency of victuall.</p>
            <p>In the morning word was brought us, That the enemy drew out He did ſo, with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſend moſt of his Cannon and Baggage, to <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> which he effected: But with a reſolution not to fight; but truſting to his ground, thinking he could march away at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>The paſſe was ſtrait between him and us, he brought two Cannons to ſecure his, and laid his Muskettiers ſtrongly in the hedges: wee beat off his Cannon, fell down upon his Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
<pb facs="tcp:186862:3"/>beat them off from their ſtrength, and where our horſe could ſcarcely paſſe two a breaſt, I commanded Major <hi>Bether</hi> to charge them with two Troops of about an hundred and twenty Horſe, which he performed with the greateſt gallantry imaginable, beat back two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the enemies Horſe, being <hi>Gorings</hi> owne Brigade, brake them at Swords point. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy charged him with neer four hundred freſh Horſe. He ſet them all going, untill oppreſſed with multitudes, he brake through them with the loſſe not of above three or foure men. Major <hi>Desborough</hi> ſeconded him with ſome other of thoſe Troops, which were about three, <hi>Bether</hi> faced about, &amp; they both ranted at ſwords point, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> great body of the enemies Horſe; which gave ſuch an unexpected terror to the enemies Army, that ſet them all a running. Our Foot in the mean time coming on bravely, and beating the enemy from their ſtrength, we preſently had the chaſe to <hi>Lamport</hi> and <hi>Bridgewater.</hi> We took and killed about 2000, brake all his Foot: We have taken very many Horſe, and conſiderable priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; what are ſlain we know not, we have the Lieutenant Generall of the Ordnance, Col: <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:186862:4"/>Colonel <hi>Heveningſham,</hi> Colonel <hi>Slingsbey,</hi> we know of: beſides very many other Officers of quality. All Major Generall <hi>Maſsies</hi> party was with him 7 or 8 miles from us, and about 1200 of our Foot, and 3 Regiments of our Horſe: ſo that we bad but 7 Regiments with us.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what the Lord hath wrought for us: Can any creature aſcribe any thing to it ſelfe? Now can we give all the glory to God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all may doe ſo: for it is all due unto him. Thus you have <hi>Long-Sutton</hi> mercy added to <hi>Naesby</hi> mercy: And to ſee this, is it not to ſee the face of God? You have heard of <hi>Naesby,</hi> it was a happy victory: As in this, ſo in that, God was pleaſed to uſe his ſervants; and if men will be malicious, and ſwell with envy, we know who hath ſaid, If they will not ſee, yet they ſhall ſee and be aſhamed for their envy at his people. I can ſay this of <hi>Naesby,</hi> that when I ſaw the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my drew up, and march in gallant order towards us, and we a company of poore ignorant men to ſeek how to order our battell: The Generall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commanded mee to order all the Horſe, I could not (riding alone about my buſineſſe) but ſmile out to God in praiſes, in aſſurance of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
<pb facs="tcp:186862:4"/>becauſe God would by things that are not, bring to nought things that are, of which I had great aſſurance, and God did it. Oh that men would therefore praiſe the Lord, and declare the wonders that he doth for the children of men.</p>
            <p>I cannot write more particulars now, I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rendevouz of all our Horſe, 3 miles from <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> we march that way. It is a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable mercy; I can better tell you then write, that God will goe on. We have taken two Guns, three Carriages of Ammunition in the Chaſe. The enemy quitted <hi>Lamport:</hi> when they ran out at one end of the town, we entred the other: they fiered that at which we ſhould chaſe, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered our purſuit, but wee over-took many of them. I beleeve wee got neere fifteen hundred horſe. Sir, I beg your Prayers: Beleeve and you ſhall be eſtabliſhed, I reſt,</p>
